# Sketches

This is just a place to keep code that I write to try things out and
which I would like to be able to go back to later in order to figure
out how to do things.  Think of this as a notebook.

Until now I've been in the habit of keeping such sketches on one of my
home servers, but this isn't exactly a brilliant idea -- for a number
of reasons.

I hope putting stuff here becomes a habit.  I haven't been terribly
good at collecting the sketches I write in any systematic manner in
the past.

Feel free to use whatever you find here to inform yourself, but be
warned:  these are just sketches I jot down to try things out.  This
is not maintained code and it isn't guaranteed to be correct, optimal
or even do something useful.  If you do find that I'm doing something
terribly stupid: feel free to send me pull-requests with
improvements.  I'd be grateful for that.
